                <h2>About Tanuja</h2>
                <p>
                  Welcome to the unofficial fan site of the legendary Tanuja Nath! When she's not casually running things as Assistant Director at Bangladesh Bank (because even national finances need a hero), she's probably solving world problems before breakfast. Legend has it that spreadsheets organize themselves when they hear Tanuja is coming to work. This site was created because the internet demanded a place to document the myths and legends of The One We Call Tanuja. Not even HTML, CSS, and JavaScript could resist joining forces to celebrate her awesomeness!

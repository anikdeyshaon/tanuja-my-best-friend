# Tanuja Nath - The Legend Unleashed

This is a surprise website I built for the unstoppable force known as Tanuja Nath, my best friend. 
She doesn’t just work at Bangladesh Bank—she commands it as Assistant Director with a mere glance. 
I forged this masterpiece with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a slideshow of her epicness, 
Chuck Norris-style facts, and a background that changes faster than you can blink. 
Tanuja’s so epic, even this README wrote itself!
